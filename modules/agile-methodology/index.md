## Agile Methodology
### Kanban
Creating a Trello account serves to put into practice the skills learned for account creation and password management. Kanban boards are also a good introduction to Agile Methodology, as they quickly create the need for backlog grooming, sprint planning, and other agile practices.

### Backlog Grooming / Sprint Planning
The backlog is already created and contains items that students should have already completed. Thus the backlog is in need of grooming: students can move items that they have already completed into a “done” column.
At the same time they will plan for the next sprint by moving items into the “This Sprint” column.
