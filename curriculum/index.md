# Course Overview

The curriculum is broken into sprints, each sprint being one week long. The lesson plans and homework for each sprint are created each week based on what was covered in the previous class and the students needs.

Each sprint has at least two documents: the Class Outline and the Homework documents. Additional documents may exist if workshops or lectures were broken out into their own files.

Most of the structured learning happened in the first 5 sprints. After that, it is mostly review and helping students with their projects.
