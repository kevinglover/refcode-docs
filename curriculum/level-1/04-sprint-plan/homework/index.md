# Sprint 4 Homework

## 1. Send Slack Message

Send a message “Hello, I am starting my homework!” to the `#general` room on Slack.  Remember to ask for help if you are getting stuck.

## 2. CSS Challenges

Need help linking your CSS files? Watch the video: [How to use the \<link\> tag for an external stylesheet.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfhMnPb2Bd0)

- Open [css2.html](./challenges/css-2.html) and complete the challenge.
- Open [css3.html](./challenges/css-3.html) and complete the challenge.
- Open [css4.html](./challenges/css-4.html) and complete the challenge.

## 3. Begin Project

Your website should have all of the following pages:

* Homepage (index.html)
* About page (about.html)

The pages should `<link>` the following CSS files:

* `styles/styles.css`
* `styles/reset.css`

> ❗️Notice the CSS files are in a seperate `styles/` folder! It is helpful to keep your HTML and CSS files organized. 

### Homepage requirements

* Use the `<img>` tag to display a picture of you.
* Link to the `about.html` page
* Begin to style your document using CSS in your `style.css` file.
* Add the `reset.css` file to the `styles` folder of your repo.
* Reference your [website sketch](../../../modules/using-css-to-style-html) to add elements, such as a header or sidebar, to your website.

### About page requirements

* Link to `index.html` (Homepage)
* Write your "developer story". This is a paragraph or list of your experience with computers up to this point.

Commit all changes to your repo and **push your changes to GitHub**.

## 4. Self Learning

Spend some time learning on your own. You can use Google or YouTube or anything else that will help you learn. Try exploring a topic on HTML or CSS that you can share with the class!
